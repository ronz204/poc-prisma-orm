### Project: Subscription Management and Recurring Billing System

This project will simulate the essential functions of a subscription-based service, such as a streaming platform or a SaaS (Software as a Service). The main objective is to manage plans, subscribed users, their subscription status and the recurring billing process.



#### Description

You will create a database in PostgreSQL to handle the business logic behind a subscription service. This involves:

- Define subscription plans with their characteristics (name, price, periodicity).
- Register users and associate them with their active subscriptions.
- Control the status of subscriptions (active, cancelled, suspended, pending renewal).
- Generate invoices on a recurring basis based on the periodicity of the plan.
- Maintain a payment history and the ability to check the financial status of subscribers.
